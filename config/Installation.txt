Installation steps for gml with Clearance, Cucumber and rSpec

Create a new Rails project and switch to that directory

	rails app-name
	cd app-name

In config/environment.rb:

config.gem "thoughtbot-clearance", 
  :lib     => 'clearance', 
  :source  => 'http://gems.github.com', 
  :version => '0.6.6'
config.gem 'rspec', 
  :version => '1.2.6', 
  :lib => false
config.gem 'rspec-rails', 
  :version => '1.2.6', 
  :lib => false

Vendor the gem:

	rake gems:install
	rake gems:unpack
	
Run "rake gems:refresh_specs" and Check that each frozen gem has a specification file:
	$ ls -l vendor/gems/*/.specification

Make sure the development database exists and run the generator:

	script/generate clearance

A number of files will be created and instructions will be printed.

You may already have some of these files. Don’t worry. You’ll be asked if you want to overwrite them.

Run the migration:

	rake db:migrate

Environment

Define a HOST constant near the top of your environment files.
In config/environments/test.rb and config/environments/development.rb it can be:

	HOST = "localhost"

In production.rb it must be the actual host your application is deployed to:

	HOST = "kwikwish.com"
	
The constant is used by mailers to generate URLs in emails.

In config/environment.rb:

	# For Thought-bot Clearance
	DO_NOT_REPLY = "donotreplyexample.com"

Delete the default routes and define root_url in your config/routes.rb:

	map.root :controller => 'home'

As your app evolves, you want to know that authentication still works. Clearance’s opinion is that you should test its integration with your app using Cucumber.

In config/environments/test.rb:

	config.gem 'webrat',
	  :version => '= 0.4.4'
	config.gem 'cucumber',
	  :version => '= 0.3.0'
	config.gem 'thoughtbot-factory_girl',
	  :lib     => 'factory_girl',
	  :source  => "http://gems.github.com", 
	  :version => '1.2.1'

Vendor the gems:

	sudo rake gems:install RAILS_ENV=test
	sudo rake gems:unpack  RAILS_ENV=test

Don’t vendor nokogiri (due to its native extensions):

	rm -rf vendor/gems/nokogiri-1.2.3

Run the Cucumber generator (if you haven’t already) and Clearance’s feature generator:

	script/generate cucumber
	script/generate clearance_features

I had to install rspec and rspec-rails as a system wide gem otherwise I get an error that I'm missing these gems:

	sudo gem install rspec-rails
	
Note that rspec is a dependency of rspec-rails so you don't have to install it specifically.

If you get the error message "config.gem: Unpacked gem ... in vendor/gems has no specification file. Run 'rake gems:refresh_specs' to fix this." do this:

	sudo rake gems:refresh_specs RAILS_ENV=test
	
Making the Cucumber tests pass:

Prepare the test database:

	Rake db:test:prepare
	
Set up a application layout file in apps/view/layouts that has a least the following:

	<% unless flash[:notice].to_s.length < 1 -%>
	
Create a HomeController

	script/generate controller home
